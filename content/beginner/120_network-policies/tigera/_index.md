title: "Network Security & Visibility using Calico Enterprise"
weight: 20

In this chapter, we are going to use two tools to secure our cluster by using network policies and then integrating our clusterâ€™s network policies with EKS security groups.

First, we will use the built-in Project Calico to enforce Kubernetes network policies in our EKS cluster, protecting our various microservices.

After that, we will use Calico Enterprise to
 1) Implement Egress Access Controls to enable your EKS workloads to communicate with other Amazon services (for example: RDS     or EC2 instances) or other API endpoints.

 2) Troubleshoot microservices that are unable to communicate with each other
 
 3) Implement and report on Enterprise Security Controls in EKS.
